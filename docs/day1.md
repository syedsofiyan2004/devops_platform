Docker is more reliable for Container Orchestration, The kubernetes needs images from docker cause it needs to run and build images on its containers to run the Application, the failure i got is i was enabling Kubernetes inside docker which was causing an internal failure, then on i was just creating a cluster inside kind, then after i created the cluster and did deployment i faced an issue of imagepulloff error, it happened because the deployment.yaml file was written in such a way that it pulls image from docker hub but i didnt upload my image to docekr hub just runned it locally.
So i just fixed it by including imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent and then the container was running properly.
